Project 3 : Program Checking
============================
In this project you need to perform semantic checks on your program.
There are a few different aspects of doing this.

First, you will need to define a symbol table that keeps track of
previously declared identifiers.  The symbol table will be consulted
whenever the compiler needs to lookup information about variable and
constant declarations.

Next, you will need to define objects that represent the different
builtin datatypes and record information about their capabilities.
See the file gonetype.py.

Finally, you'll need to write code that walks the AST and enforces
a set of semantic rules.  Here is a complete list of everything you'll
need to check:

1.  Names and symbols:

    All identifiers must be defined before they are used.  This includes variables,
    constants, and typenames.  For example, this kind of code generates an error:

       a = 3;              // Error. 'a' not defined.
       var a int;

    Note: typenames such as "int", "float", and "string" are built-in names that
    should be defined at the start of the program.

2.  Types of literals

    All literal symbols must be assigned a type of "int", "float", or "string".
    For example:

       const a = 42;         // Type "int"
       const b = 4.2;        // Type "float"
       const c = "forty";    // Type "string"

    To do this assignment, check the Python type of the literal value and attach
    a type name as appropriate.

3.  Binary operator type checking

    Binary operators only operate on operands of the same type and produce a
    result of the same type.   Otherwise, you get a type error.  For example:

        var a int = 2;
        var b float = 3.14;

        var c int = a + 3;    // OK
        var d int = a + b;    // Error.  int + float
        var e int = b + 4.5;  // Error.  int = float

4.  Unary operator type checking.

    Unary operators return a result that's the same type as the operand.

5.  Supported operators

    Here are the operators supported by each type:

    int:      binary { +, -, *, /}, unary { +, -}
    float:    binary { +, -, *, /}, unary { +, -}
    string:   binary { + }, unary { }

    Attempts to use unsupported operators should result in an error.
    For example:

        var string a = "Hello" + "World";     // OK
        var string b = "Hello" * "World";     // Error (unsupported op *)

6.  Assignment.

    The left and right hand sides of an assignment operation must be
    declared as the same type.

    Values can only be assigned to variable declarations, not
    to constants.

For walking the AST, use the NodeVisitor class defined in goneast.py.
A shell of the code is provided below.

    Class representing a symbol table.  It should provide functionality
    for adding and looking up nodes associated with identifiers.

class CheckProgramVisitor(NodeVisitor):
    '''
    Program checking class.   This class uses the visitor pattern as described
    in goneast.py.   You need to define methods of the form visit_NodeName()
    for each kind of AST node that you want to process.

    Note: You will need to adjust the names of the AST nodes if you
    picked different names.
